Web-Search-Engines-HW-1
=======================
Homework 1
1. Please run the server linserv1.cims.nyu.edu only.

2. We have attached an HTML front end file which you can run on your browser. You need to be on the NYU network for this as well.

3. The required outputs are in the results directory.

4. You can request document results on a per query basis, from the server.

5. We have also attached the click logging output. This file is generated and updated automatically. The file will be 
updated with a (previously run) query only when a brand new query is requested.

6. Evaluation results are not written exclusively, you can request evaluation results for a given query and a ranker by calling the curl and pipe the output to the Evaluator.java file. This evaluator output is on standard I/O

7. We have also provided a script (bash) file in the src folder which calls the server and generates the required output files apart from the Click Logging output.

8. We have also attached a config file of BETA values for the linear model which we read while running the program.
